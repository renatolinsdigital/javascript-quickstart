# Javascript quickstart - Essential notes by Renato Lins

  JavaScript was initially created by Brendan Eich in 1995 for Netscape with the specific purpose of enabling scripting capabilities in web browsers. The intention was to develop a scripting language that could be executed by browsers to enhance the interactivity of websites. Since then, JavaScript has evolved to become a versatile and widely-used programming language, not only for client-side scripting in browsers but also for server-side development and a variety of other applications.

  ## 1. Considerations - Why to learn Javascript

__Versatility Across Domains:__ JavaScript proves indispensable in web development (front-end and back-end), mobile app creation, game development, and IoT, showcasing its universal applicability.
