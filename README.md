# Javascript quickstart - Essential notes by Renato Lins

  JavaScript was initially created by Brendan Eich in 1995 for Netscape with the specific purpose of enabling scripting capabilities in web browsers. The intention was to develop a scripting language that could be executed by browsers to enhance the interactivity of websites. Since then, JavaScript has evolved to become a versatile and widely-used programming language, not only for client-side scripting in browsers but also for server-side development and a variety of other applications.

### 1. Considerations - Why to learn Javascript

__Versatility Across Domains:__ JavaScript proves indispensable in web development (front-end and back-end), mobile app creation, game development, and IoT, showcasing its universal applicability.

__Multi-Paradigm Language:__ JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, accommodating both object-oriented and functional programming styles, providing flexibility for developers.

__Frameworks and Libraries:__ Robust frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js expedite development, particularly for crafting intricate user interfaces and Single Page Applications (SPAs).

__NPM Ecosystem:__ The Node Package Manager (NPM) hosts a rich ecosystem of open-source packages, providing developers with a treasure trove of tools and resources to accelerate development.

__Easy Start-Up:__ JavaScript is easy to get started with â€“ all you need is a text editor and a browser, tools that are present on almost all computers.

__Productive Development Environment:__ JavaScript facilitates a productive development environment, allowing for rapid prototyping and efficient coding practices.

__Active Community and Job Opportunities:__ JavaScript's vibrant community offers support, tutorials, and a wealth of resources. Proficiency in JavaScript is in high demand, translating to a plethora of job opportunities in the tech industry.

Ps. If you're new to JavaScript and not familiar with coding environments, I recommend starting with __jsfiddle.net__ to write your initial lines of code. To observe your code in action, simply type it in the 'JavaScript' tab and click 'Run.' If you wish to view values outputted to the console (as demonstrated in future examples using the console.log command), press F12, and you'll find the output under the 'Console' tab.

### 2. Variables:

A variable is a named storage location in your computer's memory. Think of it as a labeled box where you can store and retrieve information. You create a variable in JavaScript using the ```var```, ```let```, or ```const``` keywords, followed by the variable name.

```javascript
// Example of declaring a variable using 'var'
var message;
message = "Hello, JavaScript!";

// Example of declaring and assigning a variable using 'let'
let number = 42;

// Example of declaring a constant variable using 'const'
const PI = 3.14;
```

Ps. The differences between ```var```, ```let```, and ```const``` will be discussed further once this tutorial has provided the necessary background.

### 3. Data types:

JavaScript has several data types, each serving a specific purpose. The main ones include:

__String:__ Represents text and is enclosed in single or double quotes.

```javascript
let greeting = "Hello, World!";
```

__Number:__ Represents numerical values, including integers and floating-point numbers.

```javascript
let age = 25;
```

__Boolean:__ Represents either true or false, often used for logical operations.

```javascript
let isCodingFun = true;
```

__Array:__ Represents a sequentially ordered list of values, where the first value is assigned to position 0, the second to position 1, and so on.

```javascript
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
console.log(colors[0]) // Output: red
```

__Object:__ Represents a collection of key-value pairs.

```javascript
let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isStudent: false
};
```

By now, you don't have to delve into every data type nuance, but it's crucial to understand the separation in JavaScript. Primitive types, such as strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, null, and symbols, are simple and unchangeable. Non-primitive (reference) types, such as objects, arrays, and functions, are a bit more complex in structure and can be created in various formats.

### 4. Operators:

Operators in JavaScript are powerful symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They allow you to create expressions, combining and manipulating data. Let's explore some fundamental operators with code examples:

__Assignment Operator (=):__ Assigns a value to a variable (as seen previously).

```javascript
let x = 10;
```

__Arithmetic Operators (+, -, , /, %):__ Perform basic mathematical operations.

```javascript
let sum = 5 + 3;     // Calculate sum: 5 + 3 = 8
let difference = 7 - 2;  // Calculate difference: 7 - 2 = 5
let product = 4 * 6;     // Calculate product: 4 * 6 = 24
let quotient = 10 / 2;   // Calculate quotient: 10 / 2 = 5
let remainder = 15 % 4;  // Calculate remainder: 15 % 4 = 3
```

__Comparison Operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=):__ Compare values and return a Boolean result.

```javascript
/* Equality Operator (==): Compares values and perform a implicit conversion 
of data types if needed, which is called 'type coercion' */
let isEqual = (5 == '5');   // true, values are equal after type coercion

// Strict Equality Operator (===): Compares values and data types, no type coercion
let isStrictEqual = (5 === '5');  // false due to different data types

// Inequality Operator (!=): Compares values, performs type coercion if needed
let isNotEqual = (10 != '10');   // false, values are equal after type coercion

// Strict Inequality Operator (!==): Compares values and data types, no type coercion
let isNotStrictEqual = (10 !== '10');  // true, values are not equal due to different data types

// Greater Than Operator (>): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand
let isGreaterThan = (15 > 10);   // true, 15 is greater than 10

// Less Than Operator (<): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand
let isLessThan = (5 < 8);       // true, 5 is less than 8

/* Greater Than or Equal To Operator (>=): Checks if the left operand is greater
than or equal to the right operand */
let isGreaterOrEqual = (20 >= 20);  // true, 20 is equal to 20

/* Less Than or Equal To Operator (<=): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal 
to the right operand */
let isLessOrEqual = (30 <= 25);     // false, 30 is not less than or equal to 25
```

With the knowledge we've gained so far, we can chain operators and variables to craft more elaborate comparisons:

```javascript
const x = 10;
const y = 15;
const z = 5;

// Chaining Comparison Operators
const isInRange = x < y && y > z;  // Evaluates to true if x is less than y and y is greater than z

// Another example
const isValid = x === 10 || (y < 20 && z >= 5);  
/* The expression above evaluates to true if x is exactly 10 or if y is less than 20 
and z is greater than or equal to 5 */
```

In both comparisons above, the expression will be evaluated to __true__.

Best Practice Tip: It's advisable to become accustomed to using strict equality and inequality operators (===, !==). These operators not only compare values but also consider data types, enhancing the robustness of our code.

__Logical Operators (&&, ||, !):__ Combine multiple conditions and perform logical comparisons to determine whether an expression is ```true``` or ```false```.

```javascript
// Logical AND (&&):
let isTrue = (true && false); // false

// Logical OR (||):
let isEitherTrue = (true || false); // true

// Logical NOT (!):
let isNotTrue = !true; // false
```

__Unary Operators (++, --):__ Increment or decrement a variable by 1.

```javascript
let counter = 5;
counter++;     // Increment by 1
counter--;     // Decrement by 1
```

__String Concatenation Operator (+):__ Concatenates two or more strings.

```javascript
let firstName = 'John';
let lastName = 'Doe';
let fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;  // 'John Doe'
```

### 5. Control flow I - 'if' statement

In JavaScript, the ```if``` statement is used to conditionally execute a block of code. It allows you to specify a condition, and if that condition evaluates to true, the code inside the if block will be executed. If the condition is false, the code inside the if block will be skipped. Let's look at a simple example:

```javascript
let temperature = 25;

if (temperature > 20) {
  console.log("It's a warm day!");
}
```

In this example, if the temperature variable is greater than 20, the message "It's a warm day!" will be logged to the console. You can also use an else statement to specify a block of code that will be executed if the condition in the ```if``` statement is ```false```:

```javascript
let temperature = 25;

if (temperature > 20) {
  console.log("It's a warm day!");
} else {
  console.log("It's a cool day.");
}
```

In this case, if the temperature is not greater than 20, the message "It's a cool day." will be logged. You can also chain multiple conditions using ```else if```:

```javascript
let temperature = 25;

if (temperature > 30) {
  console.log("It's a hot day!");
} else if (temperature > 20) {
  console.log("It's a warm day!");
} else {
  console.log("It's a cool day.");
}
```

Here, if the temperature is greater than 30, the message "It's a hot day!" will be logged. If the temperature is not greater than 30 but is greater than 20, the message "It's a warm day!" will be logged. Otherwise, the message "It's a cool day." will be logged.

Ps. These are just basic examples, and ```if``` statements can become more complex with logical operators, ternary operators, and other JavaScript features.

__Ternary Operators__: In JavaScript, the ternary operator provides a concise way to write simple conditional statements. It's a shorthand for an if-else statement. The syntax is:

```javascript
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
```

Here's an example to illustrate its usage:

```javascript
// Example 1: Using Ternary Operator for Assignment
let isSunny = true;
let activity = isSunny ? "Go for a walk" : "Stay indoors";

console.log(activity);  // Output: "Go for a walk"

let number = 15;
let parity = number % 2 === 0 ? "Even" : "Odd";

console.log(parity);  // Output: "Odd"
```

Chaining ternary operators for complex conditions is possible but may result in confusing code if not used carefully. Here's an example that may be considered readable by some and not by others:

```javascript
let age = 25;
let hasLicense = true;

let eligibility = age >= 18
  ? hasLicense
    ? "Allowed to drive"
    : "Cannot drive without a license"
  : "Too young to drive";
```

Explanation: The first ternary operator checks if the age is greater than or equal to 18. If ```true```, it proceeds to the next ternary operator, checking if hasLicense is true.
If both conditions are true, it assigns "Allowed to drive"; otherwise, it assigns "Cannot drive without a license". If the initial age condition is ```false```, it assigns "Too young to drive".

### 6. Control Flow II - Falsy and Truthy Values

In JavaScript, values can be broadly categorized into two groups: truthy and falsy.

__Truthy Values:__ A value is truthy if, when used in a condition (like in an if statement), it's treated as ```true```. For example, any non-empty string, any number other than 0, true, or any non-empty object is truthy.

__Falsy Values:__ A value is falsy if, in a condition, it's treated as ```false```. Examples include false, the number 0, an empty string (""), ```null```, ```undefined```, and ```NaN``` (which stands for Not a Number).

Here's are two basic examples:

```javascript
if ("Hello") {
  // This code will run because "Hello" is truthy
  console.log("Truthy!");
}

if (0) {
  // This code won't run because 0 is falsy
  console.log("Falsy!");
}
```

__Default value:__ The "default value or fallback" pattern is a concise way to assign a default value to a variable if the initial value is falsy. The pattern typically involves using the logical OR (||) operator. Here's an example to illustrate the concept:

```javascript
// Example 1:
let myVar = "Hello, World!";
let message = myVar || "Default Value";

console.log(message);  // Output: "Hello, World!"
```

### 7. Control flow III - Loops

__'for' loop:__ The ```for``` loop is used when you know the number of iterations in advance.

```javascript
// Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

__'while' loop:__ The ```while``` loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance, and the loop continues as long as a specified condition is ```true```.

```javascript
// Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop
let i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```

__'do-while' loop:__ Similar to the ```while``` loop, but the condition is checked after the loop block is executed, ensuring that the block is executed at least once.

```javascript
// Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a do-while loop
let i = 1;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i <= 5);
```

__Looping through arrays:__ While coding, we might often use loops to iterate over the elements of an array. So, the immediate code that comes to mind for doing so is:

```javascript
// Example: Iterate through an array using a for loop
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];

for (let i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) { // Not recommended, see further explanation ahead.
  console.log(colors[i]);
}
```

But there is a small problem in the code above, especially if we are looping through huge arrays or performing computationally intense tasks on each iteration. When we bring ```colors.length``` into the loop, we are making the JavaScript interpreter check/calculate the length of our array each time an iteration is executed. In some cases, this can impact how performant the code runs. In this case, we can think of something called __code refactoring__, which is nothing more than improving code that is already there but is not solving problems in an optimal way. For that particular case, we better store ```colors.length``` in a ```const``` and then start the loop code:

```javascript
// Example: Iterate through an array using a for loop
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
const colorsLength = colors.length; 

for (let i = 0; i < colorsLength ; i++) { 
  console.log(colors[i]); // Same output as before, but potentially with improved performance.
}
```

Even when the performance difference cannot be noticed, approaches like the one explained above are considered to be part of what we call __programming best practices__.

Ps. We can also iterate through arrays using the ```array.map()``` method, which will be covered later in this same tutorial.

__'for...of' loop:__ This loop in JavaScript is used to iterate over iterable objects, such as arrays, strings, and other iterable collections. It provides a more concise syntax for iterating over the values of an iterable compared to the traditional for loop. Check these examples:

```javascript
// Using for...of loop with arrays
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];

for (const color of colors) {
  console.log(color);
}

// Using for...of loop with strings
const message = 'Hello';

for (const char of message) {
  console.log(char);
}

// Using for...of loop with objects
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  city: 'New York',
};

// Object entries() method to convert object properties to an iterable
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(person)) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
}
```

Considerations while using __for...of__:

* Syntax: The ```for``` loop is more general-purpose and has a more complex syntax, allowing for more flexibility in controlling the iteration process. The ```for...of``` loop provides a simpler syntax specifically designed for iterating over iterable elements, making the code more readable and concise.

* Iterating over Values: In a ```for``` loop, you typically use an index to access elements by their position in the array or collection. In a ```for...of``` loop, you directly iterate over the values of the iterable, making it more convenient for scenarios where you are interested in the values themselves rather than their indices.

* Performance: For simple array iteration, the performance difference between the two is negligible. In more complex scenarios or with large datasets, micro-benchmarks might show differences, but these differences are unlikely to be noticeable in typical applications.

* Use cases: If you only need the values and not the indices, a ```for...of``` loop is often more concise and easier to read. If you really need both the index and the value during iteration, using a traditional ```for``` loop might be more appropriate.

__Loop control statements:__ JavaScript provides loop control statements like ```break``` and ```continue``` to alter the flow of a loop. 

```javascript
// Example 1: Use break to exit a loop early
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) {
    break; // Exit the loop when i is 5
  }
  console.log(i); // Shows 1 to 4
}

// Example 2: Use continue to skip the current iteration
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) {
    continue; // Skip the iteration when i is 3
  }
  console.log(i); // Shows 1 to 5 excluding 3
}
```

__IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION__: Loops are one of the most frequently used features in any programming language, and JavaScript provides these and other ways to loop through values. Having a good understanding of loops (in any language) is never a 'time wasted,' considering how often they are used. That's why I've decided to incorporate some 'best practices' and 'performance' tips into the __loops__ topic, even though this tutorial is tailored for beginners.

### 8. Control flow IV - switch-case statements

In JavaScript, the ```switch``` statement allows code to be executed once the ```case``` statement is fulfilled. By using ```switch-case```, we have a concise way to handle multiple scenarios for a given expression. Here's an example:

```javascript
let day = 'Friday';

switch (day) {
  case 'Monday':
    console.log('It\'s the start of the week.');
    break;
  case 'Friday': // Once case statement is fulfilled:
    console.log('It\'s almost the weekend!'); // this is the line that will log the message
    break; // and this line will make the execution to stop
  default:
    console.log('Enjoy your day.');
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how the switch statement works:

* The expression is evaluated once.
* The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
* If there is a match, the corresponding block of code is executed.
* The ```break``` statement is used to exit the switch block after a match. Without break, the control will fall through to the next case, even if it doesn't match.
* If no cases match, the default block (if present) is executed.

__When to use:__ Use ```switch-case``` when you have multiple conditions to check against a single expression. It provides a cleaner alternative to a series of ```if-else``` statements. The ```switch-case``` is suitable when you need to perform strict equality (just like when using ```===```).

__When not to use:__ If your conditions involve complex expressions or ranges, using ```switch-case``` might not be the most suitable choice. In such cases, consider using ```if-else``` statements. If your cases involve non-constant expressions (that will be evaluated), it might lead to unexpected behavior. Also it is important to avoid changing the value of the expression within the ```switch``` block, as it can lead to unpredictable results.

__Performance considerations:__ When checking a small number of conditions, the performance difference between ```switch``` and ```if-else``` is typically negligible. Modern JavaScript engines are optimized to handle both constructs efficiently. In practice, the choice between ```switch``` over ```if-else``` should be based on code readability and maintainability, not aiming to improve the performance by some miliseconds. In some complex scenarios, ```if-else``` statements can be faster than ```switch-case```, but having to worry about this is not considered typical.

Note: In the example provided, the use of ```\``` within the ```console.log``` statement ensures that the JavaScript interpreter does not become confused by the single quotes used to delimitate the string text.

### 8. Basics of functions

In JavaScript, functions are blocks of reusable code that can be defined and called upon to perform a specific task. They play a crucial role in organizing and structuring code, promoting reusability, and enhancing maintainability. There are two common ways to define functions in JavaScript: function declarations and function expressions.

__Function Declaration:__ A function declaration is a way to define a function with the function keyword, followed by the function name, a list of parameters enclosed in parentheses, and a block of code enclosed in curly braces.

```javascript
// Defining the function
function add(x, y) {
  // Calculating the sum of x and y
  const sum = x + y;
  
  // Returning the calculated sum
  return sum;
}

// Calling the function and storing the returned value on a 'const'
const mySum = add(3, 7);

// Displaying the result
console.log(mySum) // Output: 10
```

In this example:

* __add__ is the function name
* __(x, y)__ are the parameters or 'placeholders' that represent the data that the function is receiving when called
* __const sum = x + y;__ represents the function body, where the actual code is executed
* __return sum;__ is result returned after the code is executed

In JavaScript, a function declaration must have a name. The syntax for a function declaration includes the ```function``` keyword followed by the name of the function, a list of parameters enclosed in parentheses, and a block of code enclosed in curly braces. This idea is not true for function expressions (they are nameless), as we will see next.

__Function Expression:__ A function expression is another way to define a function by assigning it to a variable. This can be done using the function keyword or the more modern arrow function syntax (=>).

```javascript
// Example 1 - Using function keyword

// Defining the function while storing it as a value (as part of an expression)
const subtract = function(x, y) {
  return x - y;
};

// Calling the function and storing the returned value on a 'const'
const mySubtract = subtract(7, 3);

// Displaying the result
console.log(mySubtract) // Output: 4
```

```javascript
// Example 2 - arrow function with the arrow syntax

// Also defining the function and storing it as a value
const subtract = (x, y) => x - y;

// Calling the arrow function (nothing changes)
const mySubtract = subtract(7, 3);

// Displaying the result
console.log(mySubtract); // Output: 4
```

In both examples, the functions themselves are nameless, yet we can reference them by associating them to values. Consequently, we call ```subtract()``` as if it were a function, while, in reality, it is a variable storing a nameless function expression. The term "nameless" refers to the fact that the functions themselves don't have a separate identifier, but they are effectively named through the variables to which they are assigned.

__Function declaration vs. function expressions:__ For routine programming tasks, functions can be declared using either named or anonymous approaches. Named functions are particularly beneficial for self-referencing, such as in recursive functions, and they contribute to clearer stack traces during debugging, potentially easing the identification of functions causing issues. In the majority of scenarios, there is no substantial performance difference between named and anonymous functions. Modern JavaScript engines are optimized to efficiently handle both types. However, in certain extreme cases, named functions might exhibit a marginal speed advantage due to potential optimizations in specific JavaScript engines. Nevertheless, arrow functions are often preferred not just for their modern and concise syntax but also for their predictability, especially when developers navigate thru concepts like __hoisting__ and __context__ as we will see later on.

__Types of arrow functions:__ Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions. There are two main forms of arrow functions: the short syntax for one-liner functions, and the long syntax for functions with multiple statements or requiring a more explicit structure.

* Short Syntax (One-Liner Arrow Functions as seen previously): Here the ```return``` statement is implicit and does not require curly braces.

```javascript
// Short syntax for squaring a number
const square = (x) => x * x;
```

* Long Syntax (Block Body Arrow Functions): The long syntax is used when a function requires multiple statements or a more explicit structure. It involves using curly braces ```{}``` to define a block of code. The ```return``` statement is needed explicitly if the function is expected to return a value.

```javascript
// Long syntax for a function with conditional logic
const greet = (timeOfDay) => {
  if (timeOfDay === 'morning') {
    return 'Good morning!';
  } else {
    return 'Hello!';
  }
};
```

### 9. String manipulation - Useful approaches and methods

__Concatenation:__ Concatenation is the process of combining strings. Example: 

```javascript
const firstName = "John";
const lastName = "Doe";

const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

console.log(fullName); // Output: John Doe
```

__Template Literals:__ Template literals provide a more convenient way to create strings with embedded expressions, making concatenation with ```+``` not that necessary for most cases. Example:

```javascript
const name = "Alice";
const age = 30;

const greetingMessage = `Hello, ${name}! You are ${age} years old.`;

console.log(greetingMessage); // Output: Hello, Alice! You are 30 years old. 
```

__.length:__ The ```.length``` is a property of strings in JavaScript that is used to retrieve the number of characters a string has. Example:

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, JavaScript!";
const lengthOfGreeting = greeting.length;

console.log(`The length of the greeting is ${lengthOfGreeting} characters.`);
```

Note: Under the hood, the ```.length``` property behaves like a function that retrieves the number of characters in a string. Despite being accessed without parentheses like a typical function or method, it involves computation and is not a fixed value. The ```.length``` calculates and returns a value, so we can say we are obtaining a computed property.

__.trim():__ The ```.trim()``` method removes whitespace from both ends of a string.

Example: Removing leading and trailing whitespace

```javascript
const spacedString = "   Trim me!   ";
const trimmedString = spacedString.trim();

console.log(`Original String: "${spacedString}"`);
console.log(`Trimmed String: "${trimmedString}"`);
```

__.substring():__ The ```.substring()``` method extracts a portion of a string between two specified indices.

Example: Extracting a substring

```javascript
const sentence = "This is a sample sentence.";

// Extract a substring from index 5 to 10 (excluding 10)
const substring = sentence.substring(5, 10);

console.log(`Substring: ${substring}`); // Output: Substring: is a 
```

__.toUpperCase() and .toLowerCase():__ These methods are used to convert a string to uppercase or lowercase, respectively. Let's see:

```javascript
// Original mixed-case string
const mixedCase = "My teXt MesSage";

// Convert the string to uppercase
const upperCase = mixedCase.toUpperCase();

// Convert the string to lowercase
const lowerCase = mixedCase.toLowerCase();

// Log the uppercase and lowercase versions to the console
console.log(`Uppercase: ${upperCase}`);
// Output: Uppercase: MY TEXT MESSAGE

console.log(`Lowercase: ${lowerCase}`);
// Output: Lowercase: my text message
```

__.replace():__ This method in JavaScript is used to search for a specified value (searchValue) in a string and replace it with another value (replaceValue). Example:

```javascript
const str = "Hello, World!";
console.log(str.replace("World", "Universe")); // Outputs "Hello, Universe!"
```

In JavaScript, a multitude of string methods, including ```.indexOf()```, ```.charAt()```, ```.slice()```, ```.concat()```, and more, are at your disposal. Remember you can always consult references for the language, such as MDN or W3Schools. 

Ps. If you want to get a more in-depth understanding, you can delve into the ECMAScript Language Specifications (which is normally considered advanced), once it is a series of standards upon which JavaScript is built.

### 10. Essential array methods (.map(), .find(), .filter())

In JavaScript, ```.map()```, ```.filter()```, and ```.find()``` are essential array methods, offering concise and expressive ways to transform, filter, and retrieve elements. Often associated with modern coding approaches such as functional programming, they play a crucial role in enhancing code readability and maintainability, making them essential tools for effective JavaScript development.

__.map():__ The ```.map()``` method is used to transform each element of an array by applying a provided function to it. It creates a new array containing the results of applying the function to each element of the original array.

Example: Doubling each element in an array

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(function (num) {
  return num * 2;
});

console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In this example, the ```.map()``` method applies the function ```(num) => num * 2``` to each element in the numbers array, resulting in a new array where each element is doubled.

__.find():__ The ```.find()``` method is used to retrieve the first element in an array that satisfies a given condition. It stops iterating once the first matching element is found.

Example: Finding the first even number in an array

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 3, 5, 8, 9];

const firstEvenNumber = numbers.find(function (num) {
  return num % 2 === 0;
});

console.log(firstEvenNumber); // Output: 8
```

Here, the ```.find()``` method searches through the numbers array and returns the first element that satisfies the condition ```(num) => num % 2 === 0```, which is the number ```8```.

__.filter():__ The ```.filter()``` method is used to create a new array containing elements that satisfy a given condition. It creates a new array with all elements for which the provided function returns true.

Example: Filtering out odd numbers from an array

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(function (num) {
  return num % 2 === 0;
});

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]
```

In this example, the ```.filter()``` method creates a new array (```evenNumbers```) containing only even numbers as per the condition ```(num) => num % 2 === 0```. That way we will get the following array: ```[2, 4]```.
